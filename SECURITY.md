## Supported Versions

This project is currently under active development and is considered experimental. As such, there are no officially supported versions at this time. We encourage contributors and users to work with the latest development branch to ensure they have access to the most up-to-date features and fixes.

| Version      | Supported          |
| ------------ | ------------------ |
| Experimental | :construction:     |
| Stable       | :x:                |

Please note that as the project matures, we will provide a list of stable versions with defined support policies.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of our project seriously. If you discover a vulnerability, please report it as follows:

1. **Contact Information**: Send an email to our dedicated security team at [security@projectdomain.com](mailto:security@projectdomain.com). Ensure the subject line includes "Security Vulnerability Report."

2. **Provide Detailed Information**: Include the following details in your report:
   - A description of the vulnerability.
   - Steps to reproduce the issue.
   - The potential impact and affected versions.
   - Any possible mitigations or patches (if available).

3. **Response Time**: You can expect an acknowledgment within 48 hours of your report. Our team will work diligently to assess, verify, and address the vulnerability.

4. **Coordination**: If the issue is confirmed, we will work with you to coordinate a resolution and, if applicable, publicly disclose the vulnerability responsibly.

5. **Confidentiality**: Your report will be kept confidential until a fix is released. We may request additional details or testing from you during the resolution process.

## Contributing to Security

We encourage the community to help strengthen the security of this post-quantum blockchain Layer 1 project. Hereâ€™s how you can contribute:

1. **Code Reviews**: Examine the source code for vulnerabilities and submit findings via pull requests or issues.

2. **Testing**: Run security tests on different components, including cryptographic implementations and consensus mechanisms.

3. **Suggestions**: Share ideas for improving security practices or adding features to enhance robustness.

4. **Documentation**: Help improve documentation related to secure deployment, configuration, and usage of the software.

5. **Bug Bounties**: Participate in our bug bounty program (details available on our website) to earn rewards for reporting valid security issues.

We value your contributions and look forward to collaborating with you to build a secure, innovative, and resilient post-quantum blockchain ecosystem.
